# SpringJSR_250Annotations
This project demonstrated that how can you use [JSR-250](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.0.0.RC2/spring-framework-reference/html/ch03s09.html) annotation in `spring`. I suggest that for this project use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [STS](https://spring.io/tools) as a tool.
