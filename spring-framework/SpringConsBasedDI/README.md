# SpringConsBasedDI
This project demonstrated that How you use Dependency Injection(DI) by using constructor. Also, this demonstrated with different attributes
in XML file. This also includes nested ref attribute, neater ref attribute and value attribute in XML file for applicaton context. I suggest 
that for this project use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [STS](https://spring.io/tools) as a tool.
