# SpringJavaBasedLifeCycleCallbacks
This project demonstrated that how you can use `init` and `destroy` methods of life cycle using the java based configuration in spring framework. I suggest that for this project use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [STS](https://spring.io/tools) as a tool.
