# SpringJavaBasedBeanScope
This prooject demonstrated the 2 scopes out of others using the java based configuration in spring framework. one is singleton and second is prototype. I suggest that for this project use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [STS](https://spring.io/tools) as a tool.
