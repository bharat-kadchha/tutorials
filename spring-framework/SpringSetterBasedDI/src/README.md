# SpringSetterBasedDI
This project demonstrated that How you use Dependency Injection(DI) by using setters. This also includes nested ref attribute, neater 
ref attribute and value attribute in XML file for applicaton context. I suggest that for this project 
use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [STS](https://spring.io/tools) as a tool.
