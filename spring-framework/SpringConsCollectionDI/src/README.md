# SpringCOnsCollectionDI
This project demonstrated taht how can you inject Dependency Injection(DI) using constructor with collections like `Map`, `List`, `Set`, `Properties`.
I suggest that for this project use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [STS](https://spring.io/tools) as a tool.
