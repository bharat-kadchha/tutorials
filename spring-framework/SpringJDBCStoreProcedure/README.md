# SpringJDBCStoreProcedure
This project demonstrated that how you can use sotre procedure with spring. I am using MySQL database for this project and also, I also uploaded [Queries](https://github.com/deepdalsania/tutorials/blob/master/spring-framework/SpringJDBCStoreProcedure/src/Sqlbdquries.sql) and [StoreProcedure](https://github.com/deepdalsania/tutorials/blob/master/spring-framework/SpringJDBCStoreProcedure/src/StoreProcedure.txt) that are related to this project. I suggest that for this project use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [STS](https://spring.io/tools) as a tool.
