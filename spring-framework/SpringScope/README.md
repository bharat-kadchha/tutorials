# SpringScope
This prooject demonstrated the 2 scopes out of others. one is singleton and second is prototype. It also prove what is difference between them with practical.
Also, other scopes will be explained in a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext. I suggest that for this project use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [STS](https://spring.io/tools) as a tool.
