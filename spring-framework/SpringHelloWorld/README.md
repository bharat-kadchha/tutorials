# SpringHelloWorld
This project demonstrated that how you can print hello world using the spring framework. It also contains how mayn way to create your 
context.Also, I illustrate the difference between all ways of initializing context. I suggest that for this project use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [STS](https://spring.io/tools) as a tool.
