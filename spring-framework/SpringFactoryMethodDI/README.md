# SpringFactoryMethodDI
This project demonstrated that how you can use Dependency Injection(DI) by using Static Factory Method. Also, this includes how we can
use Non-Static Factory Method. Albeit this specifies attribute `factory-bean` and `factory-method` in XML file for application context. I suggest that for this project use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [STS](https://spring.io/tools) as a tool.
