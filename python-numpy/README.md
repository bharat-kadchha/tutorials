# Python_Numpy
This project demonstarted the `numpy` library of python from scratch. I am using `python 3.7.2` for this project. If you are using PyCharm
and you are using seperate interpreter for each project then you can simply install `numpy` as shown [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installing-uninstalling-and-upgrading-packages.html).
Also, If you want to install `numpy` by suing `pip` then do as shown [here](https://www.edureka.co/blog/install-numpy/).
Also, If you are using anaconda then `numpy` is preinstalled no need to follow any steps for more follow [this](https://problemsolvingwithpython.com/05-NumPy-and-Arrays/05.02-Installing-NumPy/#:~:text=If%20you%20installed%20the%20Anaconda,be%20used%20to%20install%20NumPy).
